# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Convert Lists Into Dictionaries
# Instructions
# Convert the two following lists, into dictionaries.
# Hint: Use the zip method
# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]

# list1 = list(zip(keys,values))
# print(list1)

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Cinemax
# Instructions
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

# Given the following object:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# Print out the familyâ€™s total cost for the movies.
# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

#  Exercise 3: Zara

 


# 2. Create a dictionary called brand which value is the information from part one (turn the info into keys and values).
# 3. Change the number of stores to 2.
# 4. Print a sentence that explains who Zaras clients are.
# 5. Add a key called country_creation with a value of Spain.
# 6. Check if the key international_competitors is in the dictionary. If it is, add the store Desigual.
# 7. Delete the information about the date of creation.
# 8. Print the last international competitor.
# 9. Print the major clothes colors in the US.
# 10. Print the amount of key value pairs (ie. length of the dictionary).
# 11. Print the keys of the dictionary.
# 12. Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with the following details:
